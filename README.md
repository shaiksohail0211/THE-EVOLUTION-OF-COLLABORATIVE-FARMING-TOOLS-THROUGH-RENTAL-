# THE-EVOLUTION-OF-COLLABORATIVE-FARMING-TOOLS-THROUGH-RENTAL-
During my Python Full Stack Web Development internship, I worked on a project titled "The Evolution of Collaborative Farming Tools Through Rental." I helped build a platform for farmers to rent tools, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django, gaining experience in full-stack development and real-world problem solving.
